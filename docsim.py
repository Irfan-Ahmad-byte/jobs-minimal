    Calculate a rating score for a given text based on the cumulative frequency of words in plavra within the text.

    The rating is normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible cumulative frequency of words in plavra, and then scaled between 0 and 5.

    Parameters:
    plavra (list): A list of words or phrases to rate the input text.
    text (str): The input text to be rated.

    Returns:
    float: The rating score between 0 and 5, where 0 indicates no relevance and 5 indicates maximum relevance.
